## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Give your CSS superpowers
-  Desktop-first workflow
-  [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Inkscape: Open Source Scalable Vector Graphics Editor

### What I learned

I continue to improve my coding skills by building such projects.

### Continued development

I want to focus on getting more comfortable with using SASS in future projects.

### Useful resources

-  [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Inkscape SVG Editor. I use it all the time when I'm working on any web project. For this project, I loaded the project designs into Inkscape and used it's in-built tools to figure out the _spacing_, _sizing_ and _positioning_ of elements throughout the project.

-  To better understand how I approached coding the project using Inkscape, have a look at this repository I made - [Designing and Coding Layouts](https://github.com/AllanKirui/designing-and-coding-layouts)
